* Restarting pjtk2

** Start Elasticsearch

Elastic search is the search engine used by project tracker. It runs
as a stand alone application that communicates with project tracker
through port 9200.

To start elasticseach:
- open command prompt
- navigate to ~/pjtk2/elasticsearch/bin
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
> elasticsearch
#+END_SRC

- a stream of text should appear in the command console indicating
  that elasticsearch has started and is waiting for communication


** Start Project Tracker
- open command prompt
- navigate to ~/pjtk2
- activate fsis virtual environment
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
> .\venv\scripts\activate
#+END_SRC

- start http server:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
> python main.py
#+END_SRC

* Trouble shooting
** verify ip address
- if cherry pie complains, it is likely that the ip address
  configured in main.py is no longer the one associated with this computer.
- You can verify the ip address by comparing the value in main.py with
  the value returned by:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
> ipconfig
#+END_SRC

* Running tests

- to run the tests from the command line:
 > py.test pjtk\tests\
