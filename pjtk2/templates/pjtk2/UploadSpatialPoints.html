                        Spatial data allows
                        Project Tracker to show sampling events
                        associated with a project on a map and find
                        projects within an arbitrary region of
                        interest.  Ultimately, the spatial data
                        associated with most projects will be
                        populated from master databases, but
                        currently the spatial data must be uploaded by
                        the project lead in either csv or xlsx files.                        
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The most appropriate level of spatial
                        resolution associated with a project depends a
                        lot on the type of project and available data:

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Coordinates of Each
                                Sample</strong> - For projects that
                                have a unique coordinate for each
                                sampling event, it is most appropriate
                                to report the actual location
                                associated with the sample. In this
                                instance, SAM can be used as the label
                                to identify the specific event.  This
                                approach applies to most of our
                                independent netting projects and
                                on-board catch sampling programs as
                                examples.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Fixed Sites</strong> - For
                                projects that collect a large number of
                                samples from a small number of sites, it
                                is most appropriate to report these by
                                using the site names as the point labels,
                                and the associated coordinates for each
                                site rather that uploading a large number
                                of duplicate points. Examples of this type of project
                                include creels, derby sampling, or fishway
                                monitoring.</li>

                            <li><strong>Grid Centroids</strong> - For
                                some projects (e.g. - commercial harvest
                                reporting), the 5-minute grid might be the
                                finest level of resolution available, in
                                which case, a list of 5-minute grid
                                centroids where the events occured would
                                adequately capture the spatial extent of
                                the project.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Synthesis/Integrated
                                Analysis</strong> - these are projects
                                that summarize data collected in other
                                projects. In most cases, the appropriate
                                level of spatial resolution are the sites
                                or samples used in the project that were
                                integrated into this analysis. Labels are
                                usually created by combining the source
                                project-site or source project-sample
                                identifiers so that users are able to find
                                the original original data associated with
                                a point.  Some examples of this type of
                                project include Lamprey wounding, CWT
                                recoveries, or non-fish species
                                reporting.</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                        
                    </p>

                        <ul>
                            
                            <li>POINT_LABEL is the text that is
                                displayed on maps in Project Tracker
                                when the point is clicked on. Do not
