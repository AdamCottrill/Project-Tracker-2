"""This file tests that the views associated with image uploads
function as expected.  Views to test include:

- project_add_image

  - login is required on this view

  - a form that is used to submit images - will need tests for both
   get and post requests and good and bad data.

  - if the project does not exists - we should raise a 404

- edit-image

  - login is required on this view

  - a view to edit the image attributes - caption and whether or not
    it should be included in the annual report.  THere should never be
    any more than two 'report' images associated with a project.  -
    this view processes a form, so we will need both get and post
    requests, as well as good and bad data.

  - if the project does not exists - we should raise a 404

- project_images

  - login is required on this view

  - a view to list the images associated with a project.  It should
    return the images in the order of the 'order' field

  - if the project does not exists - we should raise a 404

- project_sort_images

  - login is required on this view

  - this view is a little different in that it does not return a
    response.  It is called from ajax emitted by project images view.
    We should be able to create some images in a known order, submit a
    request to this view with a different order and confirm that the
    image order has been changed.

- delete_image_file

  - login is required on this view

  - a view to remove files associated with a project. If this is a GET
    request, redirect to a confirmation page.  If it is a POST, delete
    the associated image and return to the project detail page.

  - if the project does not exists - we should raise a 404
