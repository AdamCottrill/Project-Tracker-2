 Created: 05 Feb 2021 09:11:50

 DESCRIPTION:

  The tests in this file verify that the interface that allows users
  to upload spatial data works as expected:

  + only available to staff who can edit the project (owner, admin, or
  manager)

  + acceps csv or xlxs

  + append or replace

  + throws an error if the uploaded file does not have a header with
    the appopriate names

  + captures malformed points or those outside of GL Basin (for now)

  + point label is required

  + includes helpful instructions describing what spatial data is
  relevant (creels vs field project vs synthesis)

  + upload format should match format returned by api endpoint - will
  allow us to download, edit and then re-upload points.

  + consider adding download to xlsx button on each project page if
  spatial data exists.
