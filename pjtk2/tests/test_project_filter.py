 DESCRIPTION:

  pjtk2.filters contains a django filters filter for projects that
  currently allows users to select subsets of project by:

  + year  (exact)
  + first_year (gte)
  + last_year (lte)
  + prj_cd__icontains
  + lake__abbrev (value in list)
  + protocol__abbrev (value in list)
  + project_type__id (value in list)
  + project_type__scope (value in list)
